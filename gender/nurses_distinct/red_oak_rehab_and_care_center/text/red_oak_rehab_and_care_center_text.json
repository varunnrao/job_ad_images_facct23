Since we have your attention for a moment, please read a little further. You may have seen news reports about care facilities closing. That\u2019s not because people don\u2019t need care. It\u2019s due to the incredible challenge of hiring permanent staff. Our residents deserve the best care possible, and we are committed to providing it with respect, dignity and kindness. If you are a nurse, we can\u2019t do it without you! Are you looking for a change? Red Oak Rehab & Care Center is hiring RNs and LPNs to join our team. We would love to talk to you to see if we can make a match between your career goals and the needs of our residents. Please message our page, call our Administrator Cheryl Runyan at 712-623-5156.
