But if you\u2019re a \u201cSerious\u201d Driver\u2026 Are You Pulling for a \u201cSerious\u201d Carrier? Busy season is coming up fast, no doubt about it. Big loads will be everywhere, and the jobs will be plentiful. And soon enough, every Owner-Operator will be blessed with a much fatter pocketbook \u2013 that\u2019s for sure! But still, there\u2019s that lingering doubt\u2026 Am I pulling for the right carrier? I mean, how DO these other drivers on the road get to pull for the \u201cbig boys?\u201d You see them everywhere, pulling the \u201cname brand logo\u201d trailers that have super-clean loads, easy loads, the \u201chook and drop\u201d stuff. A piece of cake. Loads that are scheduled and dispatched like a jet plane take-off and landing. You know, the \u201cserious guy\u201d stuff\u2026. Now that\u2019s a real eye-opener, isn\u2019t it. You\u2019re probably saying to yourself, hey WAIT a minute!!! \u201c I\u2019M a serious guy (or gal.)\u201d And you absolutely ARE a serious Owner-Operator if the thought of actually ENJOYING those benefits makes you drool. You know, so much that you\u2019d give ANYTHING to haul for THOSE guys! Well, who do you think those shippers hire? They pretty much ONLY work through long-term contracts with larger carriers that have state-of-the-art technology and people who know how to integrate it. But technology can only get you so far. They also pretty much ONLY work through carriers that hire the \u201cbest of the best\u201d drivers \u2013 you know, the \u201cextreme-precision, extreme professionalism\u201d drivers. And all of those definitions describe us to a \u201cT\u201d. We\u2019re AM Carriers, one of America\u2019s hottest and fastest growing carriers, and we want to add new members to our fleet of dedicated Owner-Operator haulers. We\u2019re specifically looking for RGN, Low boy & Heavy Haul drivers with the correct years on the job to do the job correctly. You know, the real \u201cserious guy\u201d stuff \u2013 technique, talent and training to an impeccable degree, and the ability to prove it in a heartbeat. You know the kind of driver we\u2019re talking about: a driver who can be reliably expected to perform like clockwork, every trip and over every mile. If that describes you to a \u201ct\u201d, here is the offer we are making: * Dedicated routes, dedicated equipment * Top-industry * Grosses up to $15,000 per week. * 88% from Weekly Gross goes to the Owner-Operator * Absolute transparency * Dedicated Lanes \u2013 Hook and Drop So that\u2019s one heck of an offer, and it\u2019s for serious drivers with the track record to prove it. But more than just the great routes and scheduling imagine the true and genuine peace-of-mind of knowing that over 50 employees are working to make YOUR job easier and more predictable. Our drivers enjoy 24/7 access to our highly-sophisticated Dispatch staff. Team members work exclusively on repeat clients and repeat routes. So you enjoy incredible timing and accuracy and respect for your valuable time. Would that be \u201cserious guy\u201d kind of stuff to you? How about these OTHER \u201cserious guy\u201d kind of benefits you\u2019ll enjoy as an AM Carriers dedicated hauler: - Dedicated Lanes - Hook & Drop - No Force Dispatch - New Reliable Equipment The truth is, we\u2019re not \u201cJohnny Come Lately\u2019s\u201d in the trucking industry. Since our start in 2016 with just 2 trucks, we hit 18 in 2018, 74 in 2020, and we are now at 102 trucks and trailers. Plus, we\u2019ve got over 50 employees. How did we accomplish that \u201csweetheart\u201d of a story? Well, I\u2019ll give a lot of the credit to the hard-working, honest and dedicated drivers that have stayed with us all of these years. But a lot of the credit has to go to our massively geeky team of dispatchers and programmers. Through a combination of customer service, data interconnectivity and instant updating, they have worked a miracle. We are now DEEPLY entrenched in our client\u2019s systems and can provide them with insane amounts of data at every moment. It\u2019s a precision shipper\u2019s dream, and we fulfill it with a precision team at the home office and precision drivers in the field. We just all \u201cget it.\u201d In fact, some of our drivers find that working with AM Carriers actually helps them live a more relaxed and happy life. Sure, you\u2019ll always have frustrations on the road due to traffic, weather and other factors out of anyone\u2019s control. But it can be extremely comforting to be part of a truly efficient team of professional friends who are literally seconds away at any point, and on-point every second. But teamwork is NOT all about technology. I mean, yes \u2013 we all take the job very seriously. And together, we make sure everything is spinning like clockwork every day \u2013 or we\u2019ll make it right in record time. But we also truly do share a lot of love and laughter along the way. It really IS a fun team to work on! Our drivers also enjoy some of the best \u201cperks\u201d in the industry. You now, things like steady and reliable direct deposit pay \u2013 whether we\u2019ve been paid or not. But some of the BEST perks have nothing to do with money. It\u2019s having a say in what type of routes you like to drive, where you like to go, what equipment you prefer to pull, days home, time off. You know \u2013 the kind of \u201cperks\u201d that \u201cserious\u201d drivers enjoy \u2013 and they GET THEM ALL because they\u2019re WORTH it. If you can genuinely look at that \u201cserious guy\u201d in the mirror and say, \u201chell yes I\u2019m worth it\u201d, maybe you \u201cget it\u201d too.
