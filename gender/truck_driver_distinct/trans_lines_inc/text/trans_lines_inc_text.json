Sponsored If you\u2019ve been riding the road for a few years now, you\u2019ve seen \u201cflash in the pan / get rich quick\u201d offers from \u201cJohnny-Come-Lately\u201d truck lines come and go. Mostly they go, because they\u2019re not based on a sound, long-term relationship \u2013 or a solid company with the facts to prove it. Chances are, you\u2019ve seen a lot in this industry \u2013 so you can spot \u201cthe real deal\u201d when it comes around. So keep reading, because this is no ordinary offer. And Trans Lines is no ordinary company. True professional drivers know that the only REAL opportunities in this industry are with well-established companies with long-term contracts with top shippers. You know, the kind that doesn\u2019t put up with a lot of nonsense. REAL trucking companies truly DO their homework and only hire drivers who KNOW what they do, KNOW the types of equipment they like to pull, and KNOW the true value of a driver who can perform their duties with integrity, honor, and dedication to their team and their clients. At Trans Lines, these are the ONLY types of drivers we hire. And the drivers we DO end up selecting to work with us KNOW what they\u2019re worth. And we PAY IT. In fact, we\u2019re GLAD to pay it, because those are the quality drivers that will continue to provide for OUR success and client satisfaction. ONLY REAL PROFESSIONAL OWNER-OPERATORS NEED TO APPLY. Are you ready for a real opportunity with a legitimate top-of-the-line trucking company? Are you THROUGH driving for companies that can\u2019t quite get their act together \u2013 and leave YOU holding the bag and taking the blame? If you\u2019re ready for a REAL job pulling RELIABLE loads on CONSISTENT routes with QUALITY equipment and DEDICATED schedules, we need to talk. You\u2019ll find that Trans Lines is the kind of company that you CAN do your due diligence on. Our success story is an open book, so ask around: get the details, talk to other drivers, and see if we\u2019re the type of company you want to build a lifetime career around. We can throw down that challenge because we KNOW what you will find out about us. At Trans Lines, we ARE that kind of company. We\u2019ve been growing our business since 2012 by providing reliable, accurate, and timely delivery of our client\u2019s freight day after day, year after year. WE\u2019RE BORING AND ROUTINE. AND WE LOVE IT. As the best Owner-Operators know, when push comes to shove, hauling freight for a rock-solid company like Trans Lines is a routine. The best freight lines keep their clients happy BECAUSE they\u2019re pretty boring. They get the job done, they don\u2019t ruffle any feathers, and they DON\u2019T hire \u201cNew Kids on the Block\u201d type of drivers. They hire experienced professionals who know what it takes to do the job right \u2013 and the drivers they hire ACTUALLY DO THE JOB \u2013 Accurately; Reliably; with NO NONSENSE on their part. Are YOU that type of driver? Do YOU get mad with amateurish dispatch personnel who don\u2019t take THEIR job seriously? Do YOU wish that you had dedicated loads, dedicated routes, and a schedule you could set a clock to? Well, maybe\u2026 just maybe, you\u2019re ready for a serious career driving for a serious company. You know, one like Trans Lines. We\u2019re currently looking for top pro drivers to run dedicated routes in Midwest, East, and Southeast, (West coast loads are also available upon request.) Here are some of the \u201cboring\u201d details that don\u2019t seem to matter to amateur drivers but mean a HECK OF A LOT to a true professional Owner-Operator: \u2022 Light Loads 35,000 lbs max \u2022 Primary lanes are GA, KS, OH, NY, NJ, PA, NC, SC, MS, FL \u2022 All loads pay at least $2.70 per mile \u2022 22% from gross if company trailer is used (trailer maintenance, insurance, dispatching is included) \u2022 12% from gross if you use your own truck and trailer \u2022 Equipment must pass DOT test and have a valid annual DOT inspection \u2022 Fuel cards with discounts provided \u2022 24/7/365 Breakdown Service Telephone Line \u2022 Available subs in case your truck breaks down \u2022 Owners Gross up to $10k per week. \u2022 Trans Lines INC only works with Dry van trailers \u2013 no \u201csurprise pulls\u201d of overloaded flat-beds or Reefers with small-town routes through mountains and valleys on two-lane roads. \u2022 Trailers are also available for lease \u2022 Many dedicated contracts OTHER STUFF WE HANDLE THAT YOU WON\u2019T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ANYMORE: \u2022 IFTA filings \u2022 NY, NM, OR, KY permits and licensing \u2022 Registration services \u2022 Heavy Highway Use Tax Filing \u2022 Repair Shop \u2022 Toll Pass (one device for all 48 states) \u2022 Weigh Station PrePass (All 48 states) SO WHO ARE TRANS-LINES REALLY? You\u2019ll find that Trans Lines is satisfactorily rated by FMCSA. We have an ISS score of 47 (PASS on weigh stations) so you won\u2019t get heckled over in weigh stations. What\u2019s more, we implement the very highest safety standards to protect our drivers. We don\u2019t \u201ccut corners\u201d or use old worn-out equipment like some other carriers. And yes \u2013 we will install dash and driver-facing cameras (no live streaming option, only harsh or G force events are recorded) in your truck at our expense (no drilling in dashboards or anywhere else, everything is plug-and-play). Our safety assurances give our clients confidence in our ability to get the job done correctly and safely. And again, while \u201cordinary /run-of-the-mill\u201d drivers may not like them, true PROFESSIONAL career drivers will LOVE them. A real lifetime hauler will LOVE our safety standards because a TRUE professional has no interest in skirting the rules \u2013 or the law \u2013 at any time. Those games are for amateurs, not serious career drivers who know the value of their skills \u2013 and how to keep a good job for the long haul. ARE YOU READY TO JOIN A TRUCKING COMPANY THAT IS AS SERIOUS ABOUT ITS CRAFT AS YOU ARE? At this time, Trans Lines is looking for a few select drivers to join our team. We\u2019re ONLY looking for safe and courteous drivers who \u201cget\u201d this industry and what it takes to perform consistently at the highest levels of performance. Sure, good drivers are in short supply. Everyone knows that. But the true professional drivers also know that a top company with top clients and a top dispatch team is the \u201creal deal\u201d and worth its weight in gold. BEST CLIENTS / BEST LOADS / BEST CONSISTENCY Our clients are among the top names in the business. They look to Trans Lines to handle overflow freight so they can provide exceptional service to THEIR customers. Sure, the spot market is tight. And yes, there are plenty of \u201cone shot\u201d deals that can really make your bank account fat. But here\u2019s the REAL secret of taking a lot of these deals on an \u201conesy-twosie\u201d basis: they won\u2019t be around when things get slow in the off months. And THEN what will you do to earn steady cash? The real beauty of working for a company like Trans Lines is that we will continue to provide steady work for you ALL YEAR LONG. Our loads pay top dollar AND provide you with consistent loads year-round. We GET those reliable loads because we provide superior service to our customers. If you\u2019re the type of driver who can provide superior service to the US, we need to talk. WHAT IT TAKES / DRIVER QUALIFICATIONS: Okay, let\u2019s get down to brass tacks. MAJOR VIOLATIONS INCLUDE: 5 years with NO Major Violations 1-year CDL driving experience 3 years with no more than 2 traffic violations (any non-major violation showing on MVR) -or- 3 years with no more than 1 DOT reportable accident* 10 years with no DUIs for any driver if driver held CDL at the time of DUI (otherwise 5 years) Use of a vehicle for felonious purposes Leaving a scene of an accident (Hit & Run) or failure to stop and report an accident Reckless driving/Careless driving/Speed contest Driving while license is suspended or revoked Attempting to elude an officer of the law Speeding more than 20 mph of a posted speed limit For traffic violations (non-major) on MVR that are associated with an accident, we will only count the accident *Combination of violations/accidents cannot exceed more than 2 events in the last 3 years NO PROBLEMS? OKAY, HERE\u2019S WHAT WE PROVIDE TO YOU: Let\u2019s look at where the rubber meets the road. Big promises and lots of hype are worth exactly NOTHING when it\u2019s you on the road at 3 am with a problem. And if you\u2019re driving for Trans Lines, we\u2019ve got your back and we\u2019ll handle EVERYTHING on your behalf. So here\u2019s what we offer to YOU: FREIGHT MANAGEMENT TEAM We know a thing or two about being on the road. That\u2019s why EVERY MEMBER of our freight management team has either driven, owned or dispatched their own trucks. Because you can\u2019t truly KNOW what\u2019s needed in the field unless you\u2019ve BEEN in the field. Imagine how much noise can be eliminated when every dispatcher you\u2019ll deal with has ACTUALLY BEEN A DRIVER! EQUIPMENT We \u201cget it.\u201d Professional drivers spend a lot of time away from the comforts of home, so we want to PROVIDE many of those comforts to you on the road. And we want to make sure every trip is successful and as event-free as possible, so you can get back to the REAL comforts of your own home. That\u2019s why we equip our trucks with some of the best features and technology in the industry. Plus, we perform all regularly-scheduled maintenance on-time (unlike some carriers who cut corners by delaying maintenance to save a few bucks. Who ends up paying the price in the long run? You, the driver.) Sure, stuff happens. And, in the event of an unforeseen issue on the road, we provide 24-hour roadside assistance at our expense. So take THAT one off your worry list. At Trans Lines, the safety, comfort and satisfaction of our drivers is our #1 priority. It\u2019s how we keep our service records consistent and keep top clients coming back for more. And that\u2019s the key to true performance and steady pay for YOU! SAFETY Safety isn\u2019t a buzzword for us; we take it very seriously. That means taking care of our drivers and our trucks, on and off the road. With one of the best truck monitoring systems in the industry, our highly skilled safety managers offer personal hands-on training, logbook error elimination, and supervision of the logistics process during freight transportation. Red tape? Hardly. We \u201cdot the I\u2019s and cross the T\u2019s\u201d to keep you safe. And we provide training to keep you growing in your skill sets and increasing your value as a driver. It\u2019s our \u201ctrifecta\u201d of service performance: * Safe Trucks * Safe Drivers * Quality Work Environment ARE YOU READY TO JOIN A REAL TEAM OF PROFESSIONALS?
